The three-body wave function built on the basis of the Gaussian function, calculated using the three-body Hamiltonian with the Pauli blocking operator is studied. Analytical expressions are presented for the matrix elements of the overlap of the basis functions for both basic and alternative set of relative Jacobi coordinates. The correlation densities of the wave function are calculated and illustrated depending on the set of orbital numbers also for the main and for the alternative Jacobi coordinates.

\section*{The three-body wave function }


\subsection*{Example of a table style}


The energy dependence of total cross sections of reactions $^6\text{He}$ + Si and $^{6,9}\text{Li}$ + Si in the beam energy range 5-30 MeV/nucleon has been measured. An agreement with the published experimental data for the reaction $^6$He + Si was obtained. For the reaction $^9\text{Li}$ + Si new data in the vicinity a local enhancement of the total cross section was obtained. Theoretical analysis of possible reasons of appearance of this peculiarity in the collisions of nuclei $^6\text{He}$ and $^9\text{Li}$ with Si nuclei has been carried out including the influence of external neutrons of weakly bound projectile nuclei.

\subsection*{Example of text style and formula design in the text}


In our experiments, we employed the Dubna gas-filled recoil separator (DGRFS), that allows the separation of the products of complete fusion reactions from the beam of bombarding ions, elastically-scattered nuclei, and products of incomplete fusion. The detection system includes proportional chambers used to measure the time of flight (TOF) of particles and several semiconductor detectors with position-sensitive strips. 

The principle of operation of the separator is selection of products of the complete-fusion reaction by their charge state $q$ in a rare gas and kinematic characteristics (mass of recoil nucleus $m$ and its velocity $v$) in accordance with the separator magnetic rigidity $B\rho=mv/q$ (note, $q$ depends linearly on $v$). These values are calculated for the $xn$-reaction channel when setting the separator's parameters. 

The DGFRS strongly separates forward-peaked evaporation residues (ER), products of complete-fusion reactions, within a narrow angle with a huge suppression of the products of the transfer reactions and even incomplete fusion, e.g., $\alpha xn$ reactions. The TOF selection in the existing separators may be complemented and reinforced by the combined measurement of recoil energy and TOF. Note, the production properties "separator", "mass separation", "angular selection", and "TOF selection" were called "assignment properties" in [3].

TC(HKL)= \frac{I(hkl)}{I_0(hkl)}\diagup\frac{1}{n}\sum{\frac{I(hkl)}{I_0(hkl)}},\label{}

The first superheavy nucleus $^{289}\text{Fl}$ was discovered in the $^{244}$Pu($^{48}\text{Ca},3n$) reaction studied at DGFRS (here and after we refer to reviews [1,2] containing references to most of earlier experimental data). The decay properties of $^{289}\text{Fl}$ and descendant nuclei are shown in figure 1.
