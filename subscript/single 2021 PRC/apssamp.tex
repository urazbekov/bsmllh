The elastic and inelastic scattering of deuterons from $^{13}$C
are registered in the wide range of angles at laboratory energies 14.5 MeV and 18 MeV. 
Data on the differential cross sections  are treated within the both Optical Model and Coupled-Channels method. A new set of Optical Potential parameters are found.  
An analyses for the $d + ^{13}C^*$ nuclear reactions are carried out for the $J^\pi$ excitation levels of $^{13}C^*$: $\frac{1}{2}^+, \frac{3}{2}^-, \frac{5}{2}^+_2, \frac{5}{2}^-, \frac{1}{2}^-$, and $\frac{3}{2}^-$. 
The first excitation band, $\frac{1}{2}^+$, having a nature of single particle excitation, is used for extracting the Spectroscopic Amplitudes of $\langle ^{12}C | ^{13}C \rangle$ and $\langle ^{12}\text{C} | ^{13}C^*  ~\frac{1}{2}^+ \rangle$ overlaps. A comparison of taken spectroscopic informations with the values by other authors are presented. The deformation parameters of the rest excited states are listed.

\section{\label{sec:level1} Introduction}
A study of the structure of \carb is attractive due to its
halo structure. The halo structure of \carb is defined by a valence neutron located in $p_{\frac{1}{2}}$-shell. This fact in turn manifest itself in nuclear reactions. Moreover, 

  The interesting 
\section{Experiment}
The experiment has been carried out in the cyclotron U-150M of the Institute of nuclear physics located in Almaty, the Republic of Kazakhstan. The energy of the $d$ beam was chosen to be at the laboratory energy of 14.5 MeV. The scattered  ions of deuteron  were measured at the wide rage angles 10$^\circ$ - $100^\circ$. 
%The experimental angular distributions of elastic and inelastic scattering of deuterons from $^13$C nuclei were measured using a beam delivered by the U-150M cyclotron at the Institute of Nuclear Physics (Almaty, Kazakhstan) at E(d) = 14.5 MeV within an angular range of 10–100 degrees in the laboratory system.


For the purpose of the identification of reaction products 
the $\Delta$E–E method was used. 
The telescope detectors $\Delta$E were taken as the silicon surface barrier detectors by ORTEC\textsuperscript{\textregistered}. 
The thickness of the detectors $\Delta$E was 50 $\mu$m, while the detectors E  had the thickness of 1 mm.
The thin films of $^{13}$C with the 80\% isotopic enrichment were extracted by means of the electron-beam sputtering technique.
 It was possible to make the films self-supporting and to obtain their surface density up to 150 $\mu$g/cm$^2$.
 Two collimators with a diameter of 2 mm  were used in order to get the optimal focusing on the target. 
 
 
 In Fig. \ref{fig:spectra} the spectrum of the total deposited energy is shown measured at the $\theta_{lab}$=38$^\circ$ for the detected $d$.

\section{Coupled-Channels Method}
Consider a nuclear reaction of inelastic scattering $a+A \rightarrow a' + A^*$. We denote entrance and exit channels as $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$ correspondingly. The inelastic channel $\alpha'$ is induced with an excitation of the target nucleus $A$. 
 The Schr\"odinger equation for this system with the energy $E$ is 
 \begin{equation}
 \label{she_main}
 H \Psi =  E \Psi,
 \end{equation}
 where the Hamiltonian $H$, which may be written as
 \begin{equation}
  H =  H_\alpha+T_\alpha+V_\alpha.  
\end{equation} 
Here, $H_a$ and $H_A$ are the internal Hamiltonians of colliding nuclei, $T_\alpha$ is the kinetic energy operator, and $V_\alpha$ is the interaction potential of the $a+A$ system.  
 The corresponding total wave function $\Psi$ may be represented as 
\begin{equation}
\label{tot_wf}
\Psi=\phi_\alpha({\bf r})\chi_\alpha({\bf R}) +
\phi_{\alpha'}({\bf r})\chi_{\alpha'}({\bf R}). 
\end{equation}
Here, $\phi_\alpha$ and $\phi_{\alpha'}$ are the wave functions of ground and excited states, $\chi_{\alpha}$ and $\chi_{\alpha'}$ are the scattering wave functions of $\alpha$ and $\alpha'$ channels. The wave functions of the ground  $\phi_{\alpha'}$ and the excited  $\phi_{\alpha'}$ states satisfy the Schr\"odinger equation in the following
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
H_\alpha \phi_{\alpha}({\bf r}) = \epsilon_{\alpha}  \phi_{\alpha}({\bf r})
\end{equation} 
\begin{equation}
H_{\alpha} \phi_{\alpha'}({\bf r}) = \epsilon_{\alpha'}  \phi_{\alpha'}({\bf r}),
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

Multiplying Eqs. (\ref{she_main}) from left by the conjugated wave function Eqs. (\ref{tot_wf}) one may get the coupled equations as follow
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
\left( E - \epsilon_\alpha - K_\alpha - U_{\alpha \alpha} \right)
\chi_\alpha  \left( R \right) = 
U_{\alpha \alpha'} \chi_{\alpha'}   \left( R \right) 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\left( E - \epsilon_{\alpha'} - K_{\alpha'} - U_{\alpha' \alpha'} \right)
\chi_{\alpha'}  \left( R \right) = 
U_{\alpha \alpha'} \chi_{\alpha}   \left( R \right)  
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
Here, $U_{\alpha \alpha'}$ is the coupling potential. Depending on the considering model of excitation it may have different representation.

The nature of excitation in the $\alpha'$ channel would be collective. In the framework of \textit{the Collective Model} the coupling potential $U_{\alpha \alpha'}$  may be considered .

Inline math may be typeset using the \verb+$+ delimiters. Bold math
symbols may be achieved using the \verb+bm+ package and the
\verb+\bm{#1}+ command it supplies. For instance, a bold $\alpha$ can
be typeset as \verb+$\bm{\alpha}$+ giving $\bm{\alpha}$. Fraktur and
Blackboard (or open face or double struck) characters should be
typeset using the \verb+\mathfrak{#1}+ and \verb+\mathbb{#1}+ commands
respectively. Both are supplied by the \texttt{amssymb} package. For
example, \verb+$\mathbb{R}$+ gives $\mathbb{R}$ and
\verb+$\mathfrak{G}$+ gives $\mathfrak{G}$

In \LaTeX\ there are many different ways to display equations, and a
few preferred ways are noted below. Displayed math will center by
default. Use the class option \verb+fleqn+ to flush equations left.

Below we have numbered single-line equations; this is the most common
type of equation in \textit{Physical Review}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\chi_+(p)\alt{\bf [}2|{\bf p}|(|{\bf p}|+p_z){\bf ]}^{-1/2}
\left(
\begin{array}{c}
|{\bf p}|+p_z\\
px+ip_y
\end{array}\right)\;,
\\
\left\{%
 \openone234567890abc123\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
 \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}%
\right\}%
\label{eq:one}.
\end{eqnarray}
Note the open one in Eq.~(\ref{eq:one}).

Not all numbered equations will fit within a narrow column this
way. The equation number will move down automatically if it cannot fit
on the same line with a one-line equation:
\begin{equation}
\left\{
 ab12345678abc123456abcdef\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
 \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}%
\right\}.
\end{equation}

When the \verb+\label{#1}+ command is used [cf. input for
Eq.~(\ref{eq:one})], the equation can be referred to in text without
knowing the equation number that \TeX\ will assign to it. Just
use \verb+\ref{#1}+, where \verb+#1+ is the same name that used in
the \verb+\label{#1}+ command.

Unnumbered single-line equations can be typeset
using the \verb+\[+, \verb+\]+ format:
\[g^+g^+ \rightarrow g^+g^+g^+g^+ \dots ~,~~q^+q^+\rightarrow
q^+g^+g^+ \dots ~. \]


\subsection{Multiline equations}

Multiline equations are obtained by using the \verb+eqnarray+
environment.  Use the \verb+\nonumber+ command at the end of each line
to avoid assigning a number:
\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal M}=&&ig_Z^2(4E_1E_2)^{1/2}(l_i^2)^{-1}
\delta_{\sigma_1,-\sigma_2}
(g_{\sigma_2}^e)^2\chi_{-\sigma_2}(p_2)\nonumber\\
&&\times
[\epsilon_jl_i\epsilon_i]_{\sigma_1}\chi_{\sigma_1}(p_1),
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
\sum \vert M^{\text{viol}}_g \vert ^2&=&g^{2n-4}_S(Q^2)~N^{n-2}
        (N^2-1)\nonumber \\
 & &\times \left( \sum_{i<j}\right)
  \sum_{\text{perm}}
 \frac{1}{S_{12}}
 \frac{1}{S_{12}}
 \sum_\tau c^f_\tau~.
\end{eqnarray}
\textbf{Note:} Do not use \verb+\label{#1}+ on a line of a multiline
equation if \verb+\nonumber+ is also used on that line. Incorrect
cross-referencing will result. Notice the use \verb+\text{#1}+ for
using a Roman font within a math environment.

To set a multiline equation without \emph{any} equation
numbers, use the \verb+\begin{eqnarray*}+,
\verb+\end{eqnarray*}+ format:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum \vert M^{\text{viol}}_g \vert ^2&=&g^{2n-4}_S(Q^2)~N^{n-2}
        (N^2-1)\\
 & &\times \left( \sum_{i<j}\right)
 \left(
  \sum_{\text{perm}}\frac{1}{S_{12}S_{23}S_{n1}}
 \right)
 \frac{1}{S_{12}}~.
\end{eqnarray*}

To obtain numbers not normally produced by the automatic numbering,
use the \verb+\tag{#1}+ command, where \verb+#1+ is the desired
equation number. For example, to get an equation number of
(\ref{eq:mynum}),
\begin{equation}
g^+g^+ \rightarrow g^+g^+g^+g^+ \dots ~,~~q^+q^+\rightarrow
q^+g^+g^+ \dots ~. \tag{2.6$'$}\label{eq:mynum}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{A few notes on \texttt{tag}s} 
\verb+\tag{#1}+ requires the \texttt{amsmath} package. 
Place the \verb+\tag{#1}+ command before the \verb+\label{#1}+, if any. 
The numbering produced by \verb+\tag{#1}+ \textit{does not affect} 
the automatic numbering in REV\TeX; 
therefore, the number must be known ahead of time, 
and it must be manually adjusted if other equations are added. 
\verb+\tag{#1}+ works with both single-line and multiline equations. 
\verb+\tag{#1}+ should only be used in exceptional cases---%
do not use it to number many equations in your paper. 
Please note that this feature of the \texttt{amsmath} package
is \emph{not} compatible with the \texttt{hyperref} (6.77u) package.

Enclosing display math within
\verb+\begin{subequations}+ and \verb+\end{subequations}+ will produce
a set of equations that are labeled with letters, as shown in
Eqs.~(\ref{subeq:1}) and (\ref{subeq:2}) below.
You may include any number of single-line and multiline equations,
although it is probably not a good idea to follow one display math
directly after another.
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:whole}
\begin{eqnarray}
{\cal M}=&&ig_Z^2(4E_1E_2)^{1/2}(l_i^2)^{-1}
(g_{\sigma_2}^e)^2\chi_{-\sigma_2}(p_2)\nonumber\\
&&\times
[\epsilon_i]_{\sigma_1}\chi_{\sigma_1}(p_1).\label{subeq:2}
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{equation}
\left\{
 abc123456abcdef\alpha\beta\gamma\delta1234556\alpha\beta
 \frac{1\sum^{a}_{b}}{A^2}
\right\},\label{subeq:1}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}
Giving a \verb+\label{#1}+ command directly after the \verb+\begin{subequations}+, 
allows you to reference all the equations in the \texttt{subequations} environment. 
For example, the equations in the preceding subequations environment were
Eqs.~(\ref{eq:whole}).

\subsubsection{Wide equations}
The equation that follows is set in a wide format, i.e., it spans the full page. 
The wide format is reserved for long equations
that cannot easily be set in a single column:
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
{\cal R}^{(\text{d})}=
 g_{\sigma_2}^e
 \left(
   \frac{[\Gamma^Z(3,21)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{12}^2-M_W^2}
  +\frac{[\Gamma^Z(13,2)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{13}^2-M_W^2}
 \right)
 + x_WQ_e
 \left(
   \frac{[\Gamma^\gamma(3,21)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{12}^2-M_W^2}
  +\frac{[\Gamma^\gamma(13,2)]_{\sigma_1}}{Q_{13}^2-M_W^2}
 \right)\;. 
 \label{eq:wideeq}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
This is typed to show how the output appears in wide format.
(Incidentally, since there is no blank line between the \texttt{equation} environment above 
and the start of this paragraph, this paragraph is not indented.)

\section{Cross-referencing}
REV\TeX{} will automatically number such things as
sections, footnotes, equations, figure captions, and table captions. 
In order to reference them in text, use the
\verb+\label{#1}+ and \verb+\ref{#1}+ commands. 
To reference a particular page, use the \verb+\pageref{#1}+ command.

The \verb+\label{#1}+ should appear 
within the section heading, 
within the footnote text, 
within the equation, or 
within the table or figure caption. 
The \verb+\ref{#1}+ command
is used in text at the point where the reference is to be displayed.  
Some examples: Section~\ref{sec:level1} on page~\pageref{sec:level1},
Table~\ref{tab:table1},%
\begin{table}[b]%The best place to locate the table environment is directly after its first reference in text
\caption{\label{tab:table1}%
A table that fits into a single column of a two-column layout. 
Note that REV\TeX~4 adjusts the intercolumn spacing so that the table fills the
entire width of the column. Table captions are numbered
automatically. 
This table illustrates left-, center-, decimal- and right-aligned columns,
along with the use of the \texttt{ruledtabular} environment which sets the 
Scotch (double) rules above and below the alignment, per APS style.

\end{tabular}
\end{ruledtabular}
\end{table}
and Fig.~\ref{fig:epsart}.%



\section{Floats: Figures, Tables, Videos, etc.}
Figures and tables are usually allowed to ``float'', which means that their
placement is determined by \LaTeX, while the document is being typeset. 

Use the \texttt{figure} environment for a figure, the \texttt{table} environment for a table.
In each case, use the \verb+\caption+ command within to give the text of the
figure or table caption along with the \verb+\label+ command to provide
a key for referring to this figure or table.
The typical content of a figure is an image of some kind; 
that of a table is an alignment.%
\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics{fig_2}% Here is how to import EPS art
\caption{\label{fig:wide}Use the figure* environment to get a wide
figure that spans the page in \texttt{twocolumn} formatting.}
\end{figure*}
\begin{table*}
\caption{\label{tab:table3}This is a wide table that spans the full page
width in a two-column layout. It is formatted using the
\texttt{table*} environment. It also demonstates the use of
\textbackslash\texttt{multicolumn} in rows with entries that span
more than one column.}
\begin{ruledtabular}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
 &\multicolumn{2}{c}{$D_{4h}^1$}&\multicolumn{2}{c}{$D_{4h}^5$}\\
 Ion&1st alternative&2nd alternative&lst alternative
&2nd alternative\\ \hline
 K&$(2e)+(2f)$&$(4i)$ &$(2c)+(2d)$&$(4f)$ \\
 Mn&$(2g)$\footnote{The $z$ parameter of these positions is $z\sim\frac{1}{4}$.}
 &$(a)+(b)+(c)+(d)$&$(4e)$&$(2a)+(2b)$\\
 Cl&$(a)+(b)+(c)+(d)$&$(2g)$\footnotemark[1]
 &$(4e)^{\text{a}}$\\
 He&$(8r)^{\text{a}}$&$(4j)^{\text{a}}$&$(4g)^{\text{a}}$\\
 Ag& &$(4k)^{\text{a}}$& &$(4h)^{\text{a}}$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{ruledtabular}
\end{table*}

Insert an image using either the \texttt{graphics} or
\texttt{graphix} packages, which define the \verb+\includegraphics{#1}+ command.
(The two packages differ in respect of the optional arguments 
used to specify the orientation, scaling, and translation of the image.) 
To create an alignment, use the \texttt{tabular} environment. 

The best place to locate the \texttt{figure} or \texttt{table} environment
is immediately following its first reference in text; this sample document
illustrates this practice for Fig.~\ref{fig:epsart}, which
shows a figure that is small enough to fit in a single column. 

In exceptional cases, you will need to move the float earlier in the document, as was done
with Table~\ref{tab:table3}: \LaTeX's float placement algorithms need to know
about a full-page-width float earlier. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:wide}
has content that is too wide for a single column,
so the \texttt{figure*} environment has been used.%
\begin{table}[b]
\caption{\label{tab:table4}%
Numbers in columns Three--Five are aligned with the ``d'' column specifier 
(requires the \texttt{dcolumn} package). 
Non-numeric entries (those entries without a ``.'') in a ``d'' column are aligned on the decimal point. 
Use the ``D'' specifier for more complex layouts. }
\begin{ruledtabular}
\begin{tabular}{ccddd}
One&Two&
\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textrm{Three}}&
\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textrm{Four}}&
\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textrm{Five}}\\

  & 12537.64 & 37.66345 & 86.37 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{ruledtabular}
\end{table}

The content of a table is typically a \texttt{tabular} environment, 
giving rows of type in aligned columns. 
Column entries separated by \verb+&+'s, and 
each row ends with \textbackslash\textbackslash. 
The required argument for the \texttt{tabular} environment
specifies how data are aligned in the columns. 
For instance, entries may be centered, left-justified, right-justified, aligned on a decimal
point. 
Extra column-spacing may be be specified as well, 
although REV\TeX~4 sets this spacing so that the columns fill the width of the
table. Horizontal rules are typeset using the \verb+\hline+
command. The doubled (or Scotch) rules that appear at the top and
bottom of a table can be achieved enclosing the \texttt{tabular}
environment within a \texttt{ruledtabular} environment. Rows whose
columns span multiple columns can be typeset using the
\verb+\multicolumn{#1}{#2}{#3}+ command (for example, see the first
row of Table~\ref{tab:table3}).%

show various effects.
A table that fits in a single column employs the \texttt{table}
environment. 
Table~\ref{tab:table3} is a wide table, set with the \texttt{table*} environment. 
Long tables may need to break across pages. 
The most straightforward way to accomplish this is to specify
the \verb+[H]+ float placement on the \texttt{table} or
\texttt{table*} environment. 
However, the \LaTeXe\ package \texttt{longtable} allows headers and footers to be specified for each page of the table. 
A simple example of the use of \texttt{longtable} can be found
in the file \texttt{summary.tex} that is included with the REV\TeX~4
distribution.

There are two methods for setting footnotes within a table (these
footnotes will be displayed directly below the table rather than at
the bottom of the page or in the bibliography). The easiest
and preferred method is just to use the \verb+\footnote{#1}+
command. This will automatically enumerate the footnotes with
lowercase roman letters. However, it is sometimes necessary to have
multiple entries in the table share the same footnote. In this case,
there is no choice but to manually create the footnotes using
\verb+\footnotemark[#1]+ and \verb+\footnotetext[#1]{#2}+.
\texttt{\#1} is a numeric value. Each time the same value for
\texttt{\#1} is used, the same mark is produced in the table. The
\verb+\footnotetext[#1]{#2}+ commands are placed after the \texttt{tabular}
environment. Examine the \LaTeX\ source and output for
Tables~\ref{tab:table1} and \ref{tab:table2}
for examples.

Video~\ref{vid:PRSTPER.4.010101} 
illustrates several features new with REV\TeX4.2,
starting with the \texttt{video} environment, which is in the same category with
\texttt{figure} and \texttt{table}.%
\begin{video}

  Students explain their initial idea about Newton's third law to a teaching assistant. 
  Clip (a): same force.
  Clip (b): move backwards.

\end{video}
The \verb+\setfloatlink+ command causes the title of the video to be a hyperlink to the
indicated URL; it may be used with any environment that takes the \verb+\caption+
command.
The \verb+\href+ command has the same significance as it does in the context of
the \texttt{hyperref} package: the second argument is a piece of text to be 
typeset in your document; the first is its hyperlink, a URL.

\textit{Physical Review} style requires that the initial citation of
figures or tables be in numerical order in text, so don't cite
Fig.~\ref{fig:wide} until Fig.~\ref{fig:epsart} has been cited.

\appendix

\section{Appendixes}

To start the appendixes, use the \verb+\appendix+ command.
This signals that all following section commands refer to appendixes
instead of regular sections. Therefore, the \verb+\appendix+ command
should be used only once---to setup the section commands to act as
appendixes. Thereafter normal section commands are used. The heading
for a section can be left empty. For example,
\begin{verbatim}
\appendix
\section{}
\end{verbatim}
will produce an appendix heading that says ``APPENDIX A'' and
\begin{verbatim}
\appendix
\section{Background}
\end{verbatim}
will produce an appendix heading that says ``APPENDIX A: BACKGROUND''
(note that the colon is set automatically).

If there is only one appendix, then the letter ``A'' should not
appear. This is suppressed by using the star version of the appendix
command (\verb+\appendix*+ in the place of \verb+\appendix+).

\section{A little more on appendixes}

Observe that this appendix was started by using
\begin{verbatim}
\section{A little more on appendixes}
\end{verbatim}

Note the equation number in an appendix:
\begin{equation}
E=mc^2.
\end{equation}

\subsection{\label{app:subsec}A subsection in an appendix}

You can use a subsection or subsubsection in an appendix. Note the
numbering: we are now in Appendix~\ref{app:subsec}.

Note the equation numbers in this appendix, produced with the
subequations environment:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
E&=&mc, \label{appa}
\\
E&=&mc^2, \label{appb}
\\
E&\agt& mc^3. \label{appc}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
They turn out to be Eqs.~(\ref{appa}), (\ref{appb}), and (\ref{appc}).

% The \nocite command causes all entries in a bibliography to be printed out
% whether or not they are actually referenced in the text. This is appropriate
% for the sample file to show the different styles of references, but authors
% most likely will not want to use it.
\nocite{*}

\bibliography{apssamp}% Produces the bibliography via BibTeX.
